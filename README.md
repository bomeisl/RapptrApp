Rapptr Android Programming Test

  Thank you for considering me for a Rapptr Android Software Engineering position! To show my appreciation, I've rewritten the project
you've sent me from the ground up in Kotlin. Furthermore, I have redesigned the application outlined in the code scaffold you sent me to harnesss the full power of the latest cutting edge Kotlin based libraries and updated the architechture of the application in accordance with Google's recommended Android platform best practices! 
  Of course the finished product still has the exact look and functionality of the storyboard and specifications you sent me. However, it will improve upon the original design of the scaffold code in several significant ways: 
  
1) It will be computationally cheaper to run so loading times between will be shorter and crashes and hangs will be much less likely thanks to Kotlin's highly optimized coroutines for network and IO calls, Jetpack Compose UI components, and Compose based navigation between screens instead of starting a new Activity with an Intent for each screen. This is in accordance with Google' architecture recommendation that Activities serve only a user point of entry for applications.

2) Compose's modularity and reusability in UI design mean way fewer and more descriptive lines of code for easier debugging and quicker and simple scalability.

3) State hoisting and abstraction of state to View Models gives us stateless and modular UI emitted by Compose functions and separation of concerns between the data layer and UI layer. View Models also create a "single source of truth" data model, in accordance with unidirectional data flow as per Google best practices, and lead to eliminating entire classes of bugs.

Of course this is just the beginning of Kotlin's power and a small sample of the value I believe I can add to Rapptr Labs! Honestly, I had a lot of fun experimenting with different navigation, threading, networking, and animation paradigms in Android programming. I mixed and matched, guided by Google's best practice principles, to arrive at the final product. I hope you enjoy playing with and evaluating it as much as I enjoyed making it!
